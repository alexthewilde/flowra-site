    <h2>Retention of Data</h2>    
    <p>Flowra will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyse the use of our Service.</p>    
    <ul>

            <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>

    <h3>Payments</h3>
    <p>We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).</p>
