00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.500
There are many great musicians

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.800
that have started out

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.000
by doing cover versions of songs they loved.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Creating covers is actually a really good way

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to grow as an artist â€“

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.500
â€“ if you push yourself enough.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.000
That is, don't just perform

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
a flawless rendition of the original piece,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but aim to develop your own personal style.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
At Flowra, you can find inspiration

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.500
from other talented cover artists.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Use our tools to deliberately practice any song you like

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and grow a kick-ass repertoire.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Have fun!
